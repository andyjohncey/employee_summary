As a manager
I want to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info
so that I have quick access to emails and GitHub profiles

## Frameworks

- Use Node CLI to gather information
- install NPM packages
- JavaScript
- EJ6 template engine
- Run Jest for testing
- BootStrap for CSS

## User Input

The Node interface is started by the command "NPM start" which prompts the user to enter employees to build an engineering team.

## Roster Output

The output is generated into a html file and shows the team with employee details consisting of:

- Name
- Role
- Email Address
- Job specific field( school, gitHub page or office number )
